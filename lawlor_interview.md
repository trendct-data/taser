this is extremely raw data that was requested by the AP because we had it

it's a) not complete
there's 5 or 6 mroe towns to go
and b) it's just scraping the surface, right?

there's a lot of 

we have to make sure we're getting apples to apples if we're going to go one town to next

the goal was to have very use of the taser recorded
use being trigger fired and firing
or turning it on and pointing it at someone

some towns recorded both
some towns didnt
hartford, every single ones they recorded was an actual deployment
does that mean they didnt ever take it out? or the didnt report it

we dont know yet, we're still figuring that out

there's some racial disparity
and i think the whole goal of this
the legislatur's goal was to undersand the circumastances when stun guns are used

that's what will emerge

indivudal cases give more contet and outcomes

so the goal was not to pass judgmenet on anyone it's to provdie data to policy maekrs so they can make decisions with it

worht nothign this is the first time ever that this data was gathered over an entire state

so they can see when tasers are used and how and why

you'er begninng to see a trend here in ct and 
gaterhign this data helps policy makers and police chiefs and otehrsd ecide what they want to do with it
at least int he future the deciisons they make will be based on data instead of anecdotes

so they udnerstand what's reall;y happneing

people can draw whatever
