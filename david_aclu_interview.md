previously this data didnt exist anywhere

the signficiance of this is
we were the firs state to regulate tasers for police

we initiateid this conversation about five years ago
at that time we were urging training 
as well as detailed data collection

that did take four legislative sessions.
ultimately 2 years ago it passed the first of its kind law

one thing that policy makers, legilsators, watch dog groups
is the lack of uniform of use of force data

tasers was the most glaring example
basically the bill required the training, and ongoing trakcing

when weapon is brandished, this lengthy report has to be filled out

there are things we're concerend about ont he summary of data
each taser use in connecticut to figure otu the justufication
whether trends exist
that suggest we need to have aditional legislation

when we started this, we had the question, how big is the problem
we didnt know, 

there were some departments that did some data collection but none nearly as comprehensive as this

the racial disparity, who is tased and who is first warned about being tased
is alarming to us

there's rouglhly 25 percent of the ct population is people of color
data shows that 55 percent are people of color
that's a dispairty that's concerning and what we'll look at in greater edeatla

more subtle, the act of showing the taser and arcing it
it's preferable that police first give someone the oppp to comply

take out, trigger, sayt o suspect if you dont comply with this lawful request
like put your hands down, i'm going to taser you
it loosk like white suspects get that opp to comply more than minorities

these need to be looked at a case by case basis but there's enough basis that it will give us pause and look into further

anotehr thing we'll get in the deep dive, we'll see what

the tpe of taser used
dry stun, or darts

what kinds of injuries suffered, where they were tasered
gender
there's a lot more we can cull
it's going to take some time

there's something we will do as well as law enforcement and academics

since this is the first cmoprehensive statewide data set on taser user

there is a good thing
we were pleasantly surprised to see the number of incidents statewide
somewhere around 600 is a reasonable number for the state of connecticut
that's a positive development

another
majority of departments complied and submitted their reports

it took a decade for departments to universially submit their data

we're thankful they're taking this seriously
we think they'll look at the data and reflect and make training

connecticut's a leader in this area and we should be proud of that
